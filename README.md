# Solutions to some programming questions.
This repository contains the solutions to some of the programming challenges I thought were cool. 
I'm still learning my data structures and algorithms so I thought it would be nice if I posted my code here for future reference.
Most of my code is written in Java, C# and I'm in the process of learning Python so I'll be putting up some stuff in Python too.
