# Solutions to some programming questions.
This repository contains the solutions to some of the programming challenges I thought were cool. 
I'm still learning my data structures and algorithms so I thought it would be nice if I posted my code here for future reference.
Most of my code is written in Java, C# and I'm in the process of learning Python so I'll be putting up some stuff in Python too.
## Disclaimer - The code present in this repo is not at all perfect and is untested so I cannot guarantee it to run on all test cases. I wrote these programs mostly because I thought it would be cool to solve the problem so I didn't spend my time testing it. I know my code has some serious runtime issues and I'll definitely make sure to optimize them.
